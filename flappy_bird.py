# I found this rubric on reddit...Thought Id give it a shot
# Make an object appear on the screen.
# Make it something other than a rectangle (one student chose my face).
# Make it move SOMEHOW based on keyboard input. It doesn't have to be Flappy Bird movement.
# Make it bounce with gravity after given keyboard input. This is really the only thing that is math-y in the project.
# Prevent it from going off the screen.
# Make a pipe appear.
# Make the pipe move left across the screen.
# Make a bottom pipe appear below a top pipe and move together across the screen.
# Generate a new top/bottom pipe after a certain amount of time (or once the last pipes reach a certain point).
# Freeze everything if the bird collides with either pipe.
# Create a score that increases for every pipe the bird passes.
# Allow the player to reset the game after death.
# Hold onto a high score.
# Create frame animations for the bird.
